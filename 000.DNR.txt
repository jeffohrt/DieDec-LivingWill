I have always lived with an active DNR (since becoming an adult).

My lifestyle choices and body modifications (cosmetic - unrelated to health issues) disqualify me from both organ and blood donations.

Just my rabies vaccinations are a headache for medical professionals.

For a decade my DNR was classified as a No Heroic Measures - Walter Ohrt was the only person I ever discussed this with.  He's the person that explained that aspect of a DNR.

My paperwork for overseas has expired.  I use to register such things with either Embassies, Consulates or family doctors in the respective countries I lived in.

I still do not have a family doctor and an ER doctor is not going to do this paperwork for me.  Not in the middle of COVID.

I have one or two more hurdles with the media before I can select a law firm to represent my estate.  They will do the DNR for me.
