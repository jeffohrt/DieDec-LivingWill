July 22nd 2021, I had to testify in court against Randy Wambolt, a neighbor, sociopath, wife beater, who had threatened 2 mass shootings and tortured his wife (who has dementia) publicly and privately for a year to prevent his son from testifying.  He also came at myself and my guests with weapons for a year and half - and an assortment of other issues that are normal to me - terrifying to others.

In court, I was required to testify to my health, impending death, and seizures.

Randy used that information, recruited another person, and they came at me, hard, for months, screaming his intention to kill me by triggering a seizure.

It's all in the RCMP reports, Serious Incident Response Team documents (SIRT) and RCMP Major Crimes documents as well as other documents.

Randy started on July 23rd, recruited help in mid August - and got the seizure he wanted in late August.  I just didn't tell him.  So he kept coming, harder and harder until December - when it started to get cold outside.

I had my worst seizure to date in late August causing so much tendon, muscle and nerve damage to my right hand and arm that I'll never regain full use of it.

I was unable to hold a pen or write my name until December 2021 (almost 4 months).  I still can't do side to side motions which is why I am limited to writing in short bursts and can't work - not even the little bit of homesteading and trapping that paid the bills these last couple years since Rosanne let me go.

I can't do any physical labor with that hand.  Light hammer use (I'm helping friends with a renovation) for 15 minutes will make my hand un-usable for hours or days.
