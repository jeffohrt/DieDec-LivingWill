I continued to have small seizures throughout 2020 but as the tremor and pain in my left hand was now the worst item - and I was literally waiting to die I didn't see any point in risking COVID by going to the hospital.

As of Feb 17th 2022 - I am still on the waiting list for a family doctor - and no, I'm not going to an LPN.

I haven't yet (Feb 17th 2022) figured out the triggers for a seizure.

I had several while working in the woods with a couple families - they took my needing to lie down now and again to avoid passing out - as just whatever medical issue kept me from working a normal job.

In 2020 I started to notice a paring of my tremor in my left hand as a precursor - warning - that I might have a seizure shortly.

It's not 100% - as the tremors are a consistent problem and the seizures are an intermitent problem.
