Rosanne released me April 22nd 2019 - telling me if I go to the RCMP, if I ever repeat that Larry ate out of the food bank for 10 months, that she wouldn't wait for the seizures, she wouldn't wait for me to kill myself - she'd find me and kill me herself.

I stayed 2 more days - I drove for Dennis one day and Karen the other.  I put up with Karen that last time to see Shelley - someone who had known me since I was a child.  We went to school together as kids.  I doubt I'll ever see her again.

It took an hour to gather my things and move to Liverpool.  I had never unpacked - not in 2 years.

My worst seizure in 2019 was in early May.  For the last of April I stayed with Danielle in Lunenburg because my lease did not techincally start until May 1st.  My landlords had let me store my possessions in the apartment on April 24th - the day I left Rosanne's house.

The seizure in May 2019 was similar to the first, just stronger.  I had showered and gone to bed.  I wasn't wearing clothing as I had no bed clothes.  I made a mess so bad I had to ask my neighbors for help to clean it up.

I still didn't have health care or money - so I didn't go to a doctor.

My seizures slowed down in both frequency and strength - now that I was eating properly and not being beaten every day.
