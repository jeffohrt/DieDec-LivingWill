As of Feb 2022 my left hand / arm tremors and pain are the most frequent problem - of my new (post 2017) issues.

As of Feb 2022, my right hand / arm has plateaued in it's healing.  I'll never have full use again.

The seizures are still an issue - they are increasingly happening at night which makes going to bed difficult.
