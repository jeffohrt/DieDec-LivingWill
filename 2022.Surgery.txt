I've lost teeth at a fairly regular interval, since getting my adult teeth and becoming a teenager.  It's all tied up in childhood malnutrition and the accumulation of skeletal deformities.  As a side note - my wisdom teeth never appeared.

This is just 1 of many skeletal issues that are directly and indirectly caused by my terminal medical issues.

In 2005, my "regular" dental surgery to correct issues discovered gangrene in my jaw.  John Paul got the collect call - not for money - just the heads up I might be on a plane shortly, with my jaw in a box.  I got lucky in 2005.

I've required dental surgery since 2014.  Getting held illegally in China in 2014/15 didn't help.

In 2014, in South Korea, my family dentist pulled teeth to postpone surgery for me.
In 2015, in Canada, Tom Raddall - the son of the Tom Raddall I use to mow lawns for - pulled another to postpone surgery for me.  I think the x-ray from that visit is in the repo somewhere.

I've never gotten back to it.

My dental issues flared up when I was being held by Rosanne - she wouldn't allow me to go to a dentist - let alone pay for it.

Flare-ups are stress related - I grind my teeth when stressed - it irritates the few teeth I have left.

I didn't have the money in 2019 when I was released and by the time I scratched it together in 2020 - it was COVID and all dentists shut down.

The issue is so severe now - I'm likely to lose 5-6 teeth - if they'll do it at all.  With an impending death - and a predisposition to seizures when I'm unconcious - it'll be hard to find anyone who will want to do it.

It'll be a mess for lawyers to deal with.
